          <h2>What is the Great Emu War?</h2>
          <p>
            Three members of the Royal Australian Artillery, Maj. Gwynydd Purves 
            Wynne-Aubrey Meredith in command, Sgt. S. McMurray, and Gunner 
            J. O’Halloran, were assigned to kill roughly 20,000 emu using machine 
            guns. The assignment was made in response to petitions from local farmers 
            complaining of emu destroying their crop. The campaign lasted from 
            November to December 1932.

        <h3>Was it a Success?</h3>
        <p>
            The Great Emu War was a dissaster. After two months of the emu war, 
            fewer than 1,000 emus were reported killed. The failure was the subject 
            of national and international ridicule. When the soldiers opened fire, 
            the birds scattered in all directions, making them extremely difficult 
            targets. The group had two Lewis automatic machine guns and 10,000 
            rounds of ammunition. Ultimately, the emus were considered the “victors” 
            of the war. By 1934 the government had begun to supply farmers with 
            ammunition and had created bounties for emu hunting. Roughly 57,000 
            bounties for dead emus were claimed in six months.
