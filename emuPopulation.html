          <h2>Emu Population</h2>
          <p>
            Emu births do not take incredibly long, and as such the population 
            should have a sharp increase two months after breeding season, but 
            at the sudden increase in population another thing may follow. Along 
            with a sudden increase in the population, the resources that emu 
            survive on may plummet. Emu deaths are even throughout the year, and 
            as such the population experiences a slow decline until breeding season. 
            However, with the decline of the population more resources become 
            available to the surviving emu, allowing them to survive for a longer 
            period of time.

        <h2>Endangered?</h2>
        <p>
            No. Emu are not endangered and are fairly common throughout Australia. 
            Many birds are threatened by loss of habitat an human encroachment, however emu have 
            benefited from human intervention. They are so common that they are considered pests 
            in Australia, mostly eating the crops of farmers.
