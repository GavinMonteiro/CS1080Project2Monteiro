              one found in Australia. They average in height of 1.75 meters and weight 
              around 55 kilograms. These are flightless birds. having long necks and legs 
              and tiny wings. Generally, emu are considered to be fairly dumb and are not 
              known to problem solve. Their lifespan is 5-10 years and more in human care.
